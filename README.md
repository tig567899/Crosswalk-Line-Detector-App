# Crosswalk-Line-Detector-App
Android app made using OpenCV to help the visually impaired use crosswalks.

This app finds contours of a line on the road. When a person veers too far to the right or left, it begins vibrating, only ceasing when the
person corrects their path. 

Idea inspired by Abhinav Boyed.
